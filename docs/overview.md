
This section presents the general audience of the entire tutorial, the goals for each audience, and also how they will be achieved. 

## General audience

- Hospital IT Experts (i.e. setup MedPerf)
- Clinical Experts (i.e. data curation, data preparation: specifically annotation)
- ML Engineeris (i.e. data preparation, model dev, training, evaluation)


## Goals for each audience
- **Hospital IT Experts**: Understand how to set up MedPerf (i.e. installation, testing, creating accounts on MedPerf, identify technical issues, reporting issues)
- **Clinical Experts**: Define the clinical problem, perform the annotations, and make analysis 
- **ML Engineers**: Prepare the ML pipeline (i.e. design data preparation MLCube, FL training MLCube, FL validation MLCube, implement evaluation metrics MLCube)

## Roadmap to achieving the goals
- *Provide source code examples through a use case: BrATS*
- *Add pictures pics (e.g. gifs) Check out killercoda*
